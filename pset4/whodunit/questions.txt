1.  <stdint.h> is header which declares set of integer type having specified width( the number of bits used to store its value in a pure binary system)
2.  uintN_t is an unsigned integer of N bits, while intN_t is a signed integer of N bits. Now a size of structure is addition of memory occupied by its elements. Hence for proper memory allocation of HEADER files this specified "width" data types are used.
3.  BYTE = 1 byte, DWORD = 4 bytes, LONG = 4 bytes, WORD = 2 bytes.
4.  ASCII: BM, HEX: 424d
5.  bfsize is size(in bytes) of bitmap file, while bisize is the size required by the structure.
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper-left corner.
7.  biBitCount
8.  Maybe the file doesn't exist or the permission is denied.
9.  It reads one data element of size 14 bytes at a time.
10. 3, as sizeof(RGBTRIPLET) is 3.
11. Doesn't copy paddings...
12. If you pass it as the third parameter to fseek(), that function will know that you want to move the file pointer relative to its current position.

0.  An obscure term ostensibly referring to a lung disease caused by silica dust, sometimes cited as one of the longest words in the English language.
1.  Stands for get resources usage. Returns resource usage as a structure.
2.  16
3.  Because the second parameter of getrusage is supposed to be a pointer.
4.  Using fgetc() it reads characters from the file and checks if EOF is reached or not. If not it proceeds in the loop.
    If characters is alphabet or apostrophe (but not at start), the character is appended to the word. If the length of current
    word exceeds the length of maximum possible word or the word contains digits, get cursor (in file) to end and go for new word.
    If a word is found, terminate it with '\0' and increment words counter. Check it's spelling, get resourse usage, print misspelled
    words (incrementing misspelled counter) and prepare for new word.
5.  It takes formatted input, and any change in it can leave the pointer in an unknown state.
6.  Because both files are to be opened in read mode and aren't meant to be editted, just read and checked through.
